# 3.2.10 Repetition Statements
## Loops: the repetition structure
### Condition-controlled loop: uses a true or false condition to control the number of times that it repeats, like asking a user if they want to continue with their online shopping after they add something to their basket
#### AKA a WHILE loop
### Count-controlled loop: repeats a specific number of times depending on the conditions, such as getting all the items in a list.
#### AKA a FOR loop

## While Loops practice
### Two parts to a While loop
#### 1. A condition that is tested for a true or false value
#### 2. A statement or statements that are repeated as long as the condition is true
### Be careful of infinite loops!!!

x=0
while x<=5:
    print(x)
    x=x+1

## For Loops practice
### Can be written like if and if-else statements
### Structure:

### for item in [items]:
    ### statement 1
    ### statement 2
